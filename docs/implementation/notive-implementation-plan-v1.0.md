# Implementation Plan v1.0

# Notive Overall Implementation Plan

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines Notive's overall implementation direction at a high level, from A to Z.

It is not a detailed task list or a detailed design spec. It serves as the reference document used to write a separate detailed plan for each phase later.

---

# 2. Implementation Goal

Notive's first-pass implementation goal is to validate the core hypothesis defined in the PRD.

> Can AI document generation that reflects a company's work context reduce the time spent writing real work documents and improve document quality and reusability?

The initial implementation focuses on the following goals:

* The user can generate a draft work document with AI.
* The generated document can be saved, edited, and shared.
* Company or team templates can be applied to document generation.
* Work records and existing documents can be used as context for document generation.
* Document access can be controlled within a basic permission model.
* Administrators can manage users, organization, templates, and permissions.

# 6. Key Screen Composition

The screens needed for the first-pass implementation:

| Area | Screens |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | Login, signup, password reset |
| Onboarding | Organization create, organization invite, profile setup |
| Home | Dashboard, recent documents, recent work records |
| AI generation | Document generation request, template selection, generated-result preview |
| Documents | Document list, document detail, document editor, share settings, version history |
| Work | Work diary, to-do list |
| Search | Unified search, search-result detail |
| Admin | User management, team management, permission management, template management, activity log |
| Settings | Personal settings, organization settings, security settings |

---

# 7. Key Data Areas

The main data managed during implementation:

| Data | Description |
| --- | --- |
| User | User account information |
| Organization | Company or organization information |
| Team | Team unit (Department is unified into Team for MVP) |
| Role | User role |
| Permission | Feature and document access permissions |
| Document | Document body and metadata |
| DocumentVersion | Document revision history |
| Template | Company or team document templates |
| DiaryEntry | Work diary records |
| Todo | Work items / to-dos |
| Project | Work unit grouping documents and work records |
| SearchIndex | Searchable document information |
| ActivityLog | Key user activity records |
| AIRequestLog | AI request and result records |

---

# 8. Permission Design Direction

The initial permission model starts simple and clear.

| Role | Key permissions |
| --- | --- |
| Viewer | Read documents they are allowed to access |
| Editor | Create, edit, and request sharing on documents |
| Manager | Manage team documents, approve sharing, manage team users |
| Admin | Organization settings, user management, permission management, log viewing |

Permission decisions also use the following criteria:

* Organization
* Team
* User role
* Document owner
* Document share scope
* Per-document exception permissions

---

# 9. AI Feature Direction

AI features do not aim for full automation from day one. The first goal is a stable flow where the user makes a request, reviews the result, and edits/saves it.

## First-pass AI features

* Document draft generation
* Document summarization
* Style / tone polishing
* Title and outline generation
* Report generation from work records
* Reuse / reference of similar existing documents

---

## AI feature principles

* AI output must always be editable by the user.
* The key sources used by the AI should be shown when feasible.
* Documents the user has no permission to read must not be used in AI generation or search.
* Important work documents are saved or shared only after the user confirms.
* Failures, delays, and inaccurate output must have retry and edit flows.

---

# 10. Technical Direction

Detailed technical design lives in separate documents. This document defines direction only.

## Baseline direction

* The initial product is implemented as a Web SaaS.
* Frontend and backend prioritize fast development and operations.
* The data model assumes per-organization isolation.
* Document files and body data must be stored reliably and recoverably.
* AI features are designed so that they can be separated from regular service features.
* Future enterprise expansion is considered, but the first pass avoids excessive complexity.

---

# 11. Quality and Test Plan

## Test priority

* Login and permission handling
* Document create, save, edit, share
* AI generation result-saving flow
* Permission restriction in search results
* Admin permission changes
* Document version restore
* Document generation from work records

---

## Acceptance criteria

* A general user can complete the core document-generation flow without getting stuck.
* Documents the user has no permission for cannot be viewed or searched.
* On AI generation failure, the user understands the next action.
* No document save failures or duplicate saves.
* An admin can manage users and permissions without errors.

---

# 12. Launch Preparation Plan

## Pre-launch preparation

* Pick early customers or an internal test group
* Set up test organizations and user accounts
* Prepare representative document templates
* Prepare sample document data
* Draft operations policy
* Prepare privacy and data-handling notices
* Prepare a feedback collection channel

---

## Initial launch criteria

* The core document-generation flow works end-to-end.
* Generated documents can be saved, edited, and shared.
* Document access is restricted by basic permissions.
* Admins can manage users and templates.
* Major errors are logged and observable.
* Early user feedback can be collected.

---

# 13. Key Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP scope creep | Feature growth could delay launch | Lock scope per phase |
| AI quality variance | Output may not be directly usable for work | Strengthen templates, examples, and user-edit flow |
| Permission errors | Sensitive documents may leak | Raise permission-test priority |
| Search quality gaps | Users may not find what they want | Iterate on search feedback and result quality |
| Data structure changes | Weak initial design causes rework | Lock key data scope in Phase A |
| Operations burden | AI cost, error response, and customer questions can grow | Prepare usage monitoring and operations policy |

---
