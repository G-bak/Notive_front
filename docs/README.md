# 9. Document Management Principles

* When changing a document, check for conflicts with related documents.
* PRD changes can affect implementation plans and the API/DB/UX documents.
* Permission policy changes must be reflected in API, DB, UX, and QA documents together.
* AI generation policy changes are updated together with the AI test cases.
* Deployment/operations policy changes are reflected in QA and the launch criteria.

# 10. Suggested Next Tasks

Based on the current document set, the following work can be undertaken next:

1. Resolve and decide on undecided items
2. Author the OpenAPI spec
3. Draft the DB migration
4. Design frontend routing
5. Detailed design of the Permission Module
6. Author detailed AI prompt copy
7. Break down the QA checklist further

# 11. Git Branch Strategy

The default branch strategy:

**Until release, do not touch `main`. All development merges and pushes go to `develop` only.**

* `main`: stable version and release-anchor branch
* `develop`: development integration branch
* `feature/*`: individual feature development branch
* `fix/*`: bug fix branch
* `docs/*`: documentation change branch

Each feature must branch off `develop` into a new branch, and after completion be verified and merged into `develop`.

Working principles:

* Do not commit directly to `main`.
* Do not push directly to `main`.
* Feature implementation only happens on `feature/*` branches.
* Bug fixes happen on `fix/*` branches.
* Documentation changes happen on `docs/*` branches, or directly on `develop` for trivial edits.
* After completing work, merge into `develop` and push to `origin/develop`.
* `main` is updated only with an explicit deployment instruction.

Example:

```text
develop
  -> feature/auth-foundation
  -> feature/document-management
  -> feature/ai-document-generation
```

The `download/` folder and its contents are excluded from Git uploads and must not be referenced directly from code.
